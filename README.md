# CortanaDisable

Even when you disable Cortana from the start menu, the process SearchUI still runs in the background. It's been known to consume a lot of resources. I read about a solution at a forum, and though it is quite simple, I figured I would make a simple console utility to handle it for you quicker.


Created and tested on Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise 10.0.10240 Build 10240.
